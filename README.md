# Dockerized React.js Web Application

 This project demonstrates how to containerize and deploy a modern React.js web application using Docker. Containerization allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a portable container, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.

# Getting Started

 Follow these steps to get the Dockerized React.js web application up and running on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine.

# Installation and Deployment
1. Create a .dockerignore File:

    In your React project directory, create a .dockerignore file and add the following line to ignore the node_modules directory:

        node_modules

2. Create a Dockerfile:

    Create a Dockerfile in your project directory and add the following content:

        FROM node:17-alpine

        WORKDIR /app

        COPY package.json .

        RUN npm install

        COPY . .

        EXPOSE 3000

        CMD ["npm", "start"]

3. Create a Docker Compose File:

    Create a docker-compose.yml file in your project directory and add the following content:

            
        services:
        web:
            build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
            ports:
            - "3000:3000"
            volumes:
            - ./src:/app/src
            networks:
            - app-network
        networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge

5. Run Docker Compose:

    In your terminal, run the following command to start the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will build the Docker image and start the application container. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
